      <p>ILUS.me is a platform developed for promoting more conscious beauty product consumption by providing transparent and honest product information through user-friendly experience.</p>
        <p>
        It is inspired by Open Beauty Facts, but is a standalone environment. A built from zero front-end, new structural and user-centric features were developed to match the idea, demonstrating how open-source data can be used to engage the wider community.<br></p> 
        <p>The platform was developed as a graduation project, but is going to be developed further into a working product.</p> 
        <p>Although Open Beauty Facts is an open-source project, the usage of this current platform, its content and code is NOT allowed until further notice or until before it is discussed with the author of the project.</p>
        <p>The current version is 1.0 that includes the basic functions and UI/UX. </p>
        <p><br>More details are to come.<br><a
