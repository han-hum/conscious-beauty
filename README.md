## Environment and `/server` Notice

This project uses environment variables to handle private keys securely.  
The `.env` file was removed from version control for security reasons.

> A `.env.example` can be used as a reference if environment setup is needed.

The `/server` folder currently serves as a placeholder for potential backend functionality  
(e.g., Node.js, Express, or serverless functions).
